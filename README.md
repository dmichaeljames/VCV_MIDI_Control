# VCV_MIDI_Control
[edit: 06/25/2019]
***I am depricating v1.0 and moving on to v2.0 now that VCVrack has hit v1.0 (and features MIDI-MAP!!!). I will be switching from multiple Leonardos to a single Leo and multiplexers as it is cheaper and far more extensible (and easier).***

Arduino code for creating a custom MIDI controller for use with VCVrack (or anything else, really).

This is specifically aimed at the Arduino Leonardo R3 so you can utilize the ATmega32u4 chipset as a USB midi controller. There are other Arduinos that have the 32u4 chipset, but the Leonardo gives you 12 analog inputs (and they are cheap on Ebay).

The Leonardo_x.ino sketches are for my custom controller; MIDIcontroller_12_analog.ino is a basic sketch to get up and running.

Have fun.
